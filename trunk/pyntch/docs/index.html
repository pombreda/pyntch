<h2>What's It?</h2>
<p>
Pyntch is a PYthoN Type CHecker. It detects possible runtime
errors before actually running a code. Pyntch examines a source
code statically and infers all possible types of variables,
attributes, function arguments, and return values of each function
or method. Then it detects possible exceptions caused by type
mismatch, attribute not found, or other types of exceptions raised
from each function. Unlike other Python code checkers (such as
Pychecker or Pyflakes), Pyntch does not check the style issues.
<p>
Pyntch can infer the following information from a source code:
<ul>
<li> All possible types of objects that variables, 
function arguments or class attribtes might have.
<li> Functions or instance methods that can be actually called at each
function call, considering polymorphism.
<li> A list of calling locations for each function or method.
<li> The following types of uncaught exceptions that might occur in a certain function:
<ul>
<li> Type mismatch (e.g. adding an integer and a string).
<li> Access to undefined attributes
 (e.g. <code>obj.attr</code> where <code>obj</code> does not have attribute <code>attr</code>).
<li> Subscript access to unsubscriptable objects
 (e.g. <code>a[1]</code> where a is not a sequence).
<li> Calling something uncallable
 (e.g. <code>func(1)</code> where func is not either function, method, or class).
<li> Iteration over non-iterable objects
 (e.g. <code>sorted(x)</code> where x is not an iterable object).
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Have you experienced a TypeError caused by giving a wrong type of
arguments, say, a string object to numeric functions?  Or trying
to access a nonexistent method of a wrongly passed class that
would otherwise have such a method? 
One of the great advantages of scripting languages such as Python
is its dynamicity. You can define any functions, variables and
data structures whenever you want without elaborating the detailed
type definitions. However, this feature comes with some cost:
sometimes it is difficult to find potential errors that are caused
by type mismatch before actually running the program.
<p>
In a language like Python, there is always a risk of uncaught runtime exceptions 
that a programmer could not foresee when s/he was writing the code,
which causes sudden death of the program.
This kind of behavior is particulary unfavorable for mission
critical applications, so we want to catch these errors in
advance. Unfortunately, as the program gets larger, it's getting
hard to track these kinds of errors, and it's even harder to
prevent them by infering which types/values can be passed or
returned by each function.
<p>
Pyntch aims to help reducing these burdens by infering what kind
of types can be assigned to variables/members/function arguments
and what kind of types can be returned from a function at any time
of execution, and what kind of exceptions might be raised. This is
done by examining the code without executing it. The goal of
Pyntch is to try to analyze every possible execution path and
all possible combinations of data.
<p>
Because the purpose of Pyntch is to catch as many obscure errors
as possible before the code is acutally used in a production, it
focuses on the coverage of the analysis at the expense of its accuracy.
Sometimes Pyntch brings a lot of false positives in its result,
which need to be further examined by human programmers.

<h2>How to Install</h2>

<ol>
<li> Install <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python</a> 2.4 or newer.
<li> Download the <a href="#source">Pyntch source</a>.
<li> Extract it.
<li> Run <code>setup.py</code> to install:<br>
<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>python setup.py install</strong>
</pre></blockquote>
<li> Done!
</ol>


<a name="howtouse"></a>
<hr noshade>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>
The basic use of Pyntch is pretty simple and straightforward.
Take this sample code:
<blockquote><pre>
  $ cat mycode.py
0 def f(x,y):
1   return x+y
2 print f(3, 4)
3 print f(3, 'a')
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To check this code, simply run the check.py against the source file:
<blockquote><pre>
   $ tchecker.py mycode.py
 0 === basic.py ===
 1 loading: 'basic.py'
 2 [basic]
 3   (raises &lt;TypeError: unsupported operand Add for &lt;int&gt; and &lt;int&gt;&gt; at basic.py(2))
 4
 5   ### basic.py(1)
 6   # called at basic.py(4)
 7   # called at basic.py(3)
 8   def f(x=&lt;int&gt;, y=&lt;int&gt;|&lt;str&gt;):
 9     return &lt;int&gt;
10     raises &lt;TypeError: unsupported operand Add for &lt;int&gt; and &lt;int&gt;&gt; at basic.py(2)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The output shows several things:
<ul>
<li> Line 3 shows that running this entire code might raise a TypeError exception
   that is caused at line 2 of basic.py.
<li> Line 5-10 tells about the function defined at line 1.
<li> Line 6,7 says that this function is called from line 3 and 4.
<li> Line 8 shows the possible types of parameters to this function:
   x is an integer, and y is either an integer or string.
<li> Line 9 says that this function returns an integer.
<li> Line 10 says that this function might raise a TypeError exception caused at line 2.
</ul>

<h3>Adding a module path</h3>
<p>
Pyntch can take module names instead of actual file names as input.
Pyntch searches the Python search path that is specified by <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
environment variable, as well as stub path (explained below). If you want to instruct
Pyntch to look at different locations, use <code>-p</code> option to alter
the module search path:
<blockquote><pre>
$ <strong>tchecker.py -p /path/to/your/modules mypackage.mymodule</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Creating a stub module</h3>
<p>
Due to the nature of source level analysis, Pyntch cannot analyze
a program that uses external modules, in which the behavior of
the code is specified only in opaque binaries.  In that case, a
user can instruct Pyntch to use an alternative "stub" module which
is written in Python and defines only the return type of each
function. Python stub modules are similar to C headers, but a
Python stub is a real Python code that basically does nothing than
returning a particular type of objects that the "real" function
would return. For example, if a Python function returns an integer 
and a string (depending on its input), its stub function looks like this:
<blockquote><pre>
def f(x):
  return 0
  return ''
</pre></blockquote>
Although this looks meaningless, it is a valid Python code, and
since Pyntch ignores its execution order (see <A href="#limitations">Limitations</a> section),
Pyntch recognizes this function as one returning an integer and/or a string.
<p>
Python stub files end with "<code>.pyi</code>" in their file names.
They are usually placed in the default Python search path.
When a Python stub and its real Python module both exist, the stub module is checked.
Stub modules for several built-in modules such as <code>sys</code> or
<code>os.path</code> are included in the current Pyntch distribution.
They are normally placed in the Pyntch package directory 
(e.g. <code>/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages</code>) and
used by default instead of built-in Python modules.

<p>
Pyntch cannot correctly analyze a built-in function that returns
different types of values depending on its parameters
(notably <code>struct.unpack</code>).

<h3>Controlling warnings</h3>
<p>
Since Pyntch can produce a lot of information about a code, a user
might be overwhelmed by the amount or complexity of its
result. Pyntch offers a couple of ways for controlling the
outputs in order to provide the desired information.

<h4>Command line options:</h4>
<dl>
<dt> <code>-C <u>key</u>=<u>value</u></code>
<dd> Specify a configuration parameter (described below).

<dt> <code>-c <u>config_file</u></code>
<dd> Specify a configuration file. A configuration file is a Python 
script that defines parameters for <code>ErrorConfig</code> settings.

<dt> <code>-p <u>python_path</u></code>
<dd> Add a search path for Python modules. Multiple <code>-p</code> options are allowed.

<dt> <code>-a</code>
<dd> Same as <code>show_all=True</code>.

</dl>

<h4>Configuration parameters:</h4>
<p>
These are defined in <code>ErrorConfig</code> class (config.py).
<dl>
<dt> <code>raise_uncertain</code> <em>(boolean)</em>
<dd> Include uncertain runtime exceptions (such as file error).

<dt> <code>ignore_none</code> <em>(boolean)</em>
<dd> Supress warnings for operations against a None object.

<dt> <code>show_all</code> <em>(boolean)</em>
<dd> Displays all the possible uncatched exceptions for each function,
including exceptions that occur indirectly inside the internal function calls.

</dl>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
One of the major drawbacks of typeflow analysis is its inability
to take account of execution order (which is also true for
dataflow analysis). The sequence of statements is simply ignored
and all the possible order is considered. This is like considering
every permutation of statements in a program and combining them
into one. This sometimes brings inaccuracy to its result in
exchange for a comprehensiveness of the checking. For example,
consider the following two consecutive statements:
<blockquote><pre>
x = 1
x = 'a'
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
After executing these two statements, it is clear that variable
x has always a string object, not an integer object. However, due
to the lack of awareness of execution order, Pyntch reports this
variable might have two possible types: an integer and string.
Although we expect this kind of errors does not affect much to the
overall usefulness of the report, we provide a way to supress this
type of output. Also, Pyntch cannot detect UnboundLocalError.
<p>
Another limitation is that
Pyntch assumes the scope of each namespace is statically defined,
i.e. all the names (variables, functions, classes and attributes)
are written down in the source code. Therefore a program that
define or alter the namespace dynamically during execution cannot be
correctly analyzed. Basically, a code has to meet
the following conditions:
<ul>
<li> not using <code>globals()</code> or <code>locals()</code> function,
 nor refering to or altering <code>__dict__</code> member.
<li> not using <code>getattr</code> or <code>setattr</code>.
<li> not using <code>eval</code>, <code>compile</code> or <code>exec</code> functions.
<li> no metaclass programming.
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
(This section is still way under construction.)
<p>
The basic mechanism of Pyntch is based on the idea of "typeflow
analysis."  This is similar to dataflow analysis, which gives the
maximal set of possible data that are stored at each location
(either variable or continuation) in a program. First, it constructs
a big connected graph that represents the entire Python program.
Every expression or statement is converted to a "node", which is
an abstraact place where certain type(s) of data is stored or
passed. Then it tries to figure out what type of data goes from
one node to another.
<p>
Let us consider a trivial example:
<blockquote><pre>
A = 'xyz'
B = 2
C = a*b
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Given the above statements, Pyntch constructs a graph shown in
Fig. 1. A square shaped node is a "leaf" node, which represents a
single type of Python object. A round shaped node is a "compound"
node, which is a place that one or more types of objects can be
potentially stored. Now, the data stored at the top two leaf
nodes, which are a string and an integer object respectively, flow
down to the lower nodes and each node passes the data according to
the arrow. Both objects are "mixed" at the plus sign node, which
produces a string object (because in Python multiplying a string
and an integer gives a repreated string).  Eventually, the object
goes into variable c, which is the node at the bottom.
This way, you can infer the possible type of each variable.

<h3>Handling Dynamicity</h3>
<p>
Now take an example that involves a function:
<blockquote><pre>
  def foo(x):
    return x+1
  def bar(y):
    return y*2
  f = foo
  z = f(1)
  f = bar
  z = f(2)
</pre></blockquote>
