<h2>What's It?</h2>
<p>
Pyntch is a Python code analyzer. It can detect possible runtime
errors before actually running the code. Pyntch examines a Python
source code statically and infers all possible types of variables,
class attributes, function signatures, and return values of
each function or method. Then it detects possible errors caused
by type mismatch or other exceptions raised from each function. Unlike
other Python code checker (such as Pychecker or Pyflakes), Pyntch
does not check the style issues. 
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Pyntch is still at the
proof-of-ideas stage and not proven to be efficient or even useful.
<p>
Pyntch can detect the following types of errors:
<ul>
<li> Type mismatch (e.g. adding an integer and a string).
<li> Access to undefined attributes (e.g. "<code>obj.attr</code>" where "<code>obj</code>" does not have attribute "<code>attr</code>").
<li> Subscript access to unsubscriptable objects (e.g. <code>a[1]</code> where a is not a sequence).
<li> Calling something uncallable (e.g. <code>func(1)</code> where func is not either function, method, or class).
<li> Iteration over non-iterable objects (e.g. <code>sorted(x)</code> where x is not an iterable object).
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
One of the greatest strength on scripting languages such as Python
is its dynamicity. You can define any functions, variables and
data structures whenever you want without elaborating the detailed
specifications. However, this feature comes with some cost:
sometimes it is difficult to find potential errors that are caused
by type mismatch before actually running the program.
<p>
Have you experienced a TypeError caused by giving a wrong type of
arguments, say, a string object to numeric functions?  Or trying
to access a nonexistent method of a wrongly passed class that
would otherwise have such a method? There is always a risk of such
unexpected exceptions that cause sudden death of a Python program.
This kind of behavior is particulary unfavorable for mission
critical applications, so we want to catch these errors in
advance. Unfortunately, as the program gets larger, it's getting
hard to track these kinds of errors, and it's even harder to
prevent them by infering which types/values can be passed or
returned by each function.
<p>
Pyntch aims to help reducing these burdens by infering what kind
of types can be assigned to variables/members/function arguments
and what kind of types can be returned from a function at any time
of execution, and what kind of exceptions might be raised. This is
done by examining the code without executing it. The goal of
Pyntch is to try to analyze every possible execution path and
all possible combinations of data.
<p>
Because the purpose of Pyntch is to catch as many obscure errors
as possible before the code is acutally used in a production, it
focuses on the coverage of the analysis at the expense of its accuracy.
Sometimes Pyntch brings a lot of false positives in its result,
which need to be further examined by human programmers.

<h2>How to Install</h2>

<ol>
<li> Install <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python</a> 2.4 or newer.
<li> Download the <a href="#source">Pyntch source</a>.
<li> Extract it.
<li> Run <code>setup.py</code> to install:<br>
<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>python setup.py install</strong>
</pre></blockquote>
<li> Done!
</ol>

<hr noshade>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>
The basic use of Pyntch is pretty simple and straightforward.
Take this sample code:
<blockquote><pre>
  $ cat mycode.py
0 def f(x,y):
1   return x+y
2 print f(3, 4)
3 print f(3, 'a')
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To check this code, simply run the check.py against the source file:
<blockquote><pre>
   $ tchecker.py mycode.py
 0 === basic.py ===
 1 loading: 'basic.py'
 2 [basic]
 3   (raises &lt;TypeError: unsupported operand Add for &lt;int&gt; and &lt;int&gt;&gt; at basic.py(2))
 4
 5   ### basic.py(1)
 6   # called at basic.py(4)
 7   # called at basic.py(3)
 8   def f(x=&lt;int&gt;, y=&lt;int&gt;|&lt;str&gt;):
 9     return &lt;int&gt;
10     raises &lt;TypeError: unsupported operand Add for &lt;int&gt; and &lt;int&gt;&gt; at basic.py(2)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The output shows several things:
<ul>
<li> Line 3 shows that running this entire code might raise a TypeError exception
   that is caused at line 2 of basic.py.
<li> Line 5-10 tells about the function defined at line 1.
<li> Line 6,7 says that this function is called from line 3 and 4.
<li> Line 8 shows the possible types of parameters to this function:
   x is an integer, and y is either an integer or string.
<li> Line 9 says that this function returns an integer.
<li> Line 10 says that this function might raise a TypeError exception caused at line 2.
</ul>

<h3>Adding a module path</h3>


<h3>Creating a stub module</h3>
<p>
Due to the nature of source level analysis, Pyntch cannot analyze
a program that uses extension modules, in which the code behavior
are embedded in opaque binaries.  In that case, a user can
instruct Pyntch to use an alternative "stub" module which is
written in Python and defines only the return type of each
function, just like C headers.

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
One of the major drawbacks of typeflow analysis is its inability
to take account of execution order (which is also true for
dataflow analysis). The sequence of statements is simply ignored
and all the possible order is considered. This is like considering
every permutation of statements in a program and combining them
into one. This sometimes brings inaccuracy to its result in
exchange for a comprehensiveness of the checking. For example,
consider the following two consecutive statements:
<blockquote><pre>
  x = 1
  x = 'a'
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
After executing these two statements, it is obvious that variable
x has always a string object, not an integer object. However, due
to the lack of awareness of execution order, Pyntch reports this
variable might have two possible types: an integer and string.
Although we expect this kind of errors does not affect much to the
overall usefulness of the report, we provide a way to supress this
type of output. Also, Pyntch cannot detect UnboundLocalError.
<p>
Pyntch assumes the scope of each namespace is statically defined,
i.e. all the names (variables, functions, classes and attributes)
are written down in the source code. Therefore a program that
Pyntch can analyze correctly has to meet the following conditions:
<ul>
<li> not altering __dict__, globals(), locals()
<li> not using getattr, setattr
<li> not using eval, compile or exec
<li> no metaclass programming
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
(This section is still way under construction.)
<p>
The basic mechanism of Pyntch is based on the idea of "typeflow
analysis."  This is similar to dataflow analysis, which gives the
maximal set of possible data that are stored at each location
(either variable or continuation) in a program. First, it constructs
a big connected graph that represents the entire Python program.
Every expression or statement is converted to a "node", which is
an abstraact place where certain type(s) of data is stored or
passed. Then it tries to figure out what type of data goes from
one node to another.
<p>
Let us consider a trivial example:
<blockquote><pre>
  a = 'xyz'
  b = 2
  c = a*b
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Given the above statements, Pyntch constructs a graph shown in
Fig. 1. A square shaped node is a "leaf" node, which represents a
single type of Python object. A round shaped node is a "compound"
node, which is a place that one or more types of objects can be
potentially stored. Now, the data stored at the top two leaf
nodes, which are a string and an integer object respectively, flow
down to the lower nodes and each node passes the data according to
the arrow. Both objects are "mixed" at the plus sign node, which
produces a string object (because in Python multiplying a string
and an integer gives a repreated string).  Eventually, the object
goes into variable c, which is the node at the bottom.
This way, you can infer the possible type of each variable.

<h3>Handling Dynamicity</h3>
<p>
Now take an example that involves a function:
<blockquote><pre>
  def foo(x):
    return x+1
  def bar(y):
    return y-1
  f = foo
  z = f(1)
  f = bar
  z = f(2)
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Preventing Explosion</h3>
